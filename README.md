## Project 1 - Build a Portfolio Site

This project is a responsive home page for a portfolio web site. This project consists of just the home page - any links to deeper parts of the site are not functional in this project (they currently link back to the home page).

### Target platforms
This site is designed for recent browsers (across multiple devices) that support HTML5. It has been specifically tested
with the following platforms/browsers:

- MacOS / Safari
- MacOS / Chrome
- Windows 10 / Edge
- Windows 10 / Chrome
- Nexus 5 / Chrome
- iPad / Safari

### Responsive features
The site is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience on different devices/browsers and has the following
responsive features:

- The size and aspect ratio of images changes based on the browser size and device pixel density
- The nav bar menu collapses into a burger menu on smaller devices
- The layout changes based on the size/orientation of the browser/device
